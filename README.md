First big project of first year at Epitech at the end of the pool

Creation of a calculator able to display the result of the evaluation of an arithmetic expression composed of integers of infinite size expressed in any base.

## Build
```
make
```
## Usage and Run
```
./calc base operators size_read

- base: all the symbols of the base
- operators: the symbols for the parentheses and the 5 operators
- size_read: number of characters to be read
```

## Example to use the program
```
echo '3+6' | ./calc 0123456789 '()+-*/%' 3
9
```
```
echo ‘-(12-(4*32))’ | ./calc 0123456789 ‘()+-*/%’ 12
